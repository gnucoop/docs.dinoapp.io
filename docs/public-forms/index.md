# Filling In a Public Form

Some forms in Dino can be shared with anyone via a direct link, with no account or login required. If someone has sent you a link to fill in a form, this page explains how to complete and submit it.

!!! note
    Public forms are shared by administrators or team members. If you are looking for this link, check your email or ask the person who invited you to fill in the form.

## Completing the Form

1. Open the link you received. The form will load automatically in your browser.
2. Read the form title at the top of the page to confirm you have opened the correct form.
3. Fill in all the fields shown on the page. Required fields must be completed before you can submit.
4. If the form has multiple sections or pages, use the **navigation bar at the top** of the form to move between them.
5. Once all required fields are filled in, click the **send button** (the floating circular button with an arrow icon) to submit your answers.

The send button is disabled until the form is valid. If it remains greyed out, scroll through the form to find any fields that still need to be completed.

## After Submitting

If your submission is accepted, the form will be replaced by a confirmation screen showing:

> **The form has been successfully submitted.** ✓

A notification will also appear at the bottom of the screen. If you need to fill in the same form again — for example, to record another entry — click **"Fill out another one"** in that notification. This will reload the page with a blank form.

## Troubleshooting

### The send button is greyed out and cannot be clicked

!!! warning
    One or more required fields have not been filled in, or contain invalid values. Scroll through the entire form and look for fields highlighted in red — these need to be corrected before you can submit.

### "Unable to save form."

!!! warning
    Your submission could not be saved, possibly due to a temporary connection problem. Click **"Try again"** in the notification at the bottom of the screen. If the problem persists, check your internet connection and try reloading the page. If it continues to fail, contact the person who sent you the link.

### "Oops! We could not find this Form Schema."

!!! warning
    The link you used does not point to a valid form. This can happen if the link is incomplete, has been modified, or if the form has been removed. Contact the person who sent you the link and ask for an updated one.

### The page is blank or the form does not load

!!! warning
    This may be caused by a slow connection or a temporary problem. Try refreshing the page. If the form still does not appear, check that the link you received is complete and has not been cut off — public form links include an identifier at the end (for example: `/f/abc123`).
