# Chatting with Your Data (AI)

The Data Chat page lets you ask plain-language questions about the submissions collected for a form. The AI assistant analyses the data and returns answers in text, tables, or charts.

!!! note "Optional feature"
    This feature requires a DataChat API key and may not be available in your installation. If you cannot see this option, contact your administrator.

## Accepting the Terms of Use

The first time you use Data Chat, you will be shown a terms of use statement. Read it and click **Accept** to continue.

Your acceptance is saved on your device, so you will not be asked again on future visits.

---

## Entering Your API Key

After accepting the terms, you will be asked to enter your **DataChat API key**.

1. Type your API key into the field.
2. Press **Enter** or click the **arrow button** to submit it.

The system will verify the key. If it is valid, the chat interface will load. Your key is saved on your device so you do not need to re-enter it next time.

!!! warning "Invalid API Key"
    If the key is rejected, check that you have entered it correctly. An error message will appear beneath the field if the key is not recognised.

!!! warning "Service unavailable"
    If the message *"DINO-AI is not responding at the moment"* appears, the service may be temporarily unavailable. Try again later.

## Asking Questions

Once the chat is ready, you will see a preview of your data and a text input at the bottom of the screen.

1. Click inside the text field and type your question (for example: *"How many entries were submitted last month?"* or *"Show me a chart of responses by location"*).
2. Press **Enter** to send.
3. The assistant will process your question and display the answer in the chat history above. Responses may appear as text, tables, or charts.

You can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions. If the assistant suggests follow-up questions, you can click on them to send them directly.

## Providing Feedback

Each response includes a thumbs-up and thumbs-down button. Use these to rate the quality of the answer. Your feedback helps improve the assistant over time.
