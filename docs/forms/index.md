# Data Collection

The Data Collection area is the central hub for all form-based data entry in Dino. From here you can access every form schema your team works with, submit new entries, review existing submissions, and explore collected data on a map or through AI-assisted analysis.

## Navigating the Area

When you open the Data Collection area, you will see a list of all available form schemas. Each item in the list shows the form's name and icon.

Click on a form schema to open its submissions list, where you can browse, add, or manage individual form entries.

!!! note "Managing form schemas"
    Creating and editing form schemas requires additional permissions. If you need to set up a new form structure or modify an existing one, see [Managing Form Schemas](managing-templates.md) or contact your administrator.
