# Filling In a Form

This page explains how to fill in a new form entry. You reach this page by opening a form from the submissions list and clicking the **+ button** to create a new entry.

## Selecting Metrics

!!! note "Optional step"
    This step only appears if your installation uses contextual metrics (such as projects, locations, or organisations). If your form goes directly to the data fields, skip to the next section.

When the form opens, the first step asks you to select the metrics that this entry relates to — for example, the project or location it belongs to.

1. Use the dropdown fields to choose a value for each metric.
2. Once the required metrics are selected, click **Go to form** or the forward arrow to proceed to the form fields.

You can go back to this step at any time by clicking the **back arrow** at the top of the form.

!!! note "Recording audio"
    Some forms support audio input. If a microphone button is visible in the metrics step, you can record a spoken response and the system will attempt to transcribe it and fill in the relevant fields automatically.

## Filling In the Form Fields

Fill in all the required fields shown on the page. Required fields must be completed before you can save the entry.

If the form has multiple sections, you can navigate between them using the tabs or navigation bar at the top of the form.

A status bar may appear at the top of the form showing the workflow stages available for this entry.

## Saving Your Entry

Once all required fields are completed, two buttons are available in the bottom-right corner of the screen:

- **Save form** (floppy disk icon) — saves the entry. The save button is disabled until all required fields are filled in correctly.
- **Save draft** (save-as icon) — saves the entry without completing validation. Use this to record partial work and come back to it later.

!!! note "Offline file uploads"
    If your form includes file attachment fields and you are not connected to the internet, a warning will appear when you try to save. The entry itself will still be saved, but attached files will not be uploaded until you are back online.

A confirmation message will appear at the bottom of the screen when the entry has been saved.
