# Exploring Data on a Map

The Map View shows all submissions for a form on an interactive map. Entries are displayed as markers on the map, grouped into clusters when many points are close together.

---

## Using the Map

- **Zoom in and out** using the scroll wheel or the + / − controls on the map.
- **Click on a cluster** to zoom in and expand it into individual markers.
- **Click on a marker** to view basic details for that submission.

---

## Filtering the Data

A filter panel is available above the map to narrow down which entries are shown:

- **From date / To date** — show only submissions created within a date range.
- **Field filters** — one or more field-specific filters may be available, depending on the form's structure. Each filter shows an autocomplete input for selecting a value from that field.

After setting your filters, click **Apply Filters** to update the map with the selected criteria.
