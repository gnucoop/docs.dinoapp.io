# Viewing & Managing Submissions

The submissions list shows all entries recorded for a specific form template. From here you can browse, search, view details, edit, export, and manage individual entries.

---

## Browsing the List

The list displays all submissions for the selected form. The total number of entries matching your current filters is shown at the top.

Use the **pagination controls** to move between pages, or jump to the first or last page.

You can also change which **columns** are visible by clicking the **column selector button** (grid icon) in the table header.

## Searching and Filtering

A filter bar above the list lets you narrow down which entries are shown:

- **Keyword search** — type any word to filter entries whose fields contain that text.
- **From date / To date** — show only entries created within a date range.
- **Metric filters** — filter by project, location, organisation, case, or other metric types.
- **Status filter** — show only entries with a specific workflow status.
- **User filter** — show only entries created by a specific user or user group.
- **Saved filters (presets)** — save your current filter combination as a preset for quick access later. Use the preset menu in the filter bar to save, load, or delete presets.

To remove a filter, click the **×** inside that field.

## Row Actions

Each row has a set of action icons on the right. The actions available depend on your permissions:

- **View** (eye icon) — open the entry in read-only mode.
- **Edit** (pencil icon) — open the entry for editing.
- **Print** (printer icon) — generate a PDF version of the entry.
- **Export as Word** (document icon) — download the entry as a Word document.
- **Duplicate** (copy icon) — create a new draft entry pre-filled with this entry's data.
- **Delete** (bin icon) — permanently delete the entry. A confirmation prompt will appear.
- **Print badge** — generate a badge document for this entry.
- **View log** — see the history of changes made to this entry.

    Not all actions are visible to every user. The actions shown depend on your assigned permissions.
