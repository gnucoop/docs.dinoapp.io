# Welcome to Dino

Dino is a web-based platform for structured data collection, monitoring, and analysis. It gives teams a single place to design forms, gather information from the field, track progress, and explore results — whether you are online or working in low-connectivity environments.

---

## What You Can Do with Dino

### Collect Data

Design form schemas and use them to record information from the field. Forms can have multiple sections, support file and audio attachments, and follow workflow stages (statuses) as entries move through a process. Submissions can be filtered, exported, and visualised on a map.

- [Filling In a Form](forms/filling-in-a-form.md)
- [Viewing & Managing Submissions](forms/viewing-submissions.md)
- [Exploring Data on a Map](forms/map-view.md)

### Analyse with AI

Ask plain-language questions about your collected data using the built-in AI assistant. Get answers as text, tables, or charts — no technical knowledge required.

- [Chatting with Your Data](forms/data-chat.md)

### Stay Informed

Receive in-app notifications from the system or your administrator. Click a notification to be taken directly to the relevant area of the application.

- [Notifications](notifications/index.md)

### Share Forms Publicly

Share a form with anyone via a direct link — no account required. Useful for collecting responses from people outside your organisation.

- [Filling In a Public Form](public-forms/index.md)

### Administer the Platform

Administrators can manage user accounts and permission groups, and control the translations shown throughout the interface.

- [Managing Users & Groups](administration/users.md)
- [Managing Languages](administration/languages.md)

## Access and Permissions

Some areas — such as administration and form schema management — are only visible to users with the appropriate role. If you cannot find a feature described in this documentation, contact your system administrator.
