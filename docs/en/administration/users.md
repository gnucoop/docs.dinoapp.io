# Managing Users & Groups

The Users area lets administrators manage who can access Dino and what they are allowed to do. It is divided into two sections: **Users**, for individual accounts, and **Groups**, for sets of permissions that can be assigned to multiple users at once.

!!! warning "Administrator access only"
    This area is only visible to users with the Administrator role. If you cannot see it in the navigation, contact your system administrator.

## Navigating the Users Area

When you open the Users area, you will see a menu with two options:

- **Users** — manage individual user accounts.
- **Groups** — manage permission groups.

Click either option to open the corresponding section.

## Users

### Browsing the User List

The Users list shows all accounts in the system, displaying each user's **email address**, **full name**, and a **Disabled** toggle indicating whether the account is currently active.

The total number of users matching your current filters is shown at the top of the list.

### Searching and Filtering

- Type in the **keyword search** field to filter users by any text in their details.

- Use the **User Groups** filter to show only users who belong to a specific permission group.
- Clear any filter by clicking the **×** icon inside that field.

### Enabling or Disabling a User

Each row contains a toggle in the **Disabled** column. Click the toggle directly in the list to enable or disable a user account without opening the editor.

### Adding a New User

## Groups

Permission groups define what areas, forms, reports, and data a set of users can access. Assigning a user to a group grants them all the permissions defined for that group.

### Browsing the Groups List

The Groups list shows all permission groups by name. The total count is shown at the top of the page.

### Searching and Filtering

- Use the **keyword search** field to filter groups by name.
- Use the **From date** and **To date** fields to filter by creation date.
- Use the metric filters (**Project**, **Location**, **Thematic Area**, **Case**, **Organization**) to find groups associated with specific data scopes.
- Clear any filter by clicking the **×** icon inside that field.

### Adding a New Group

1. Click the **+ button** (floating button at the bottom-right of the page).
2. A dialog will open showing a categorised list of available items to assign to the group. Items are grouped into categories such as **Roles**, **Form Schemas**, **Form Statuses**, **Report Schemas**, and any active metric types.
3. Enter a **group name** in the name field at the top of the dialog.
4. Select the items you want to include in the group by clicking them. At least one **Role** must be selected before you can save.
5. Click **Save** to create the group.

A confirmation message will appear with the group name when it has been saved.

### Editing a Group

2. The editor dialog will open with the group's current configuration pre-loaded.
3. Update the name or add and remove items as needed. At least one Role must remain selected.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

### Viewing a Group

Click the **eye icon** on a group's row to open its configuration in read-only mode. Click **Close** when done.

### Deleting a Group

1. Click the **delete icon** on the group's row.
2. A confirmation prompt will appear. Confirm to permanently delete the group.
