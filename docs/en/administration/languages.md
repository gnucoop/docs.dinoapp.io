# Managing Languages

The **Languages** page allows administrators to manage all the translated text used throughout Dino. From here, you can browse, edit, and add translations, manage which languages are available, and export translation files for backup or editing.

## Browsing Translations

The main view shows a list of all translation entries. Each entry displays its **key** — the internal identifier used by the application — and, when a language is selected, the corresponding translated text.

A loading indicator is shown while the translation data is being fetched.

### Filtering the List

Two controls at the top of the page let you narrow down the entries shown:

- **Keyword search** — type any word to filter entries whose key or translation contains that text. The list updates as you type.
- **Language selector** — a row of buttons shows **Key** and one button for each available language. Click a language name to display that language's translations alongside each key. Entries with no translation for the selected language are shown as *(No translation)*.

## Editing a Translation Entry

1. Click on any entry in the list to open the **Edit Translation** dialog.
2. The dialog shows the **key** and a text field for each available language.
3. Update the translations as needed.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes, or **Undo** to close without saving.

You can also permanently remove an individual entry from this dialog by clicking the **Remove** button. This deletes the translation key and all its associated translations.

!!! warning
    Removing a translation entry is permanent. The key and all its language values will be deleted.

## Adding a New Translation Entry

Use this when you need to add a translation key that does not yet exist in the system.

1. Click the **+ Translation** button in the toolbar.
2. The **Add Translation** dialog will open. It contains one text field for each currently active language.
3. Enter the translation text for each language as needed.
4. Click **Save** to add the new entry, or **Undo** to cancel.

A confirmation message will appear briefly after the entry has been saved.

## Managing Languages

Use this to add a new language, update an existing language's translations, or remove a custom translation set.

1. Click the **Language** button in the toolbar.
2. The **Language Settings** dialog will open. It shows a list of available languages and provides the following actions:

### Adding a New Language

1. Click the **+ button** at the top of the dialog.
2. A form will appear asking for a **language label** (the name that will appear in the interface, for example "French" or "fr").
3. Optionally, upload a **JSON translation file** by clicking **Add JSON** and selecting a file from your device. The file's contents will be previewed before saving.
4. Click **Save** to add the language, or **Undo** to cancel.

### Viewing an Existing Language

Click a language name button to select it. The dialog will show a preview of all the translation keys and values currently stored for that language.

### Updating a Language's Translations

With a language selected, click **Update translation** to upload a new JSON file. The dialog will preview the changes — new keys added and modified keys — before you save.

1. Click **Update translation** and select a JSON file from your device.
2. Review the preview showing added and modified rows.
3. Click **Save** to apply the update, or **Undo** to cancel.

### Removing a Custom Translation

With a language selected, click **Remove custom translation** to delete the custom translation data for that language.

!!! warning
    This removes the custom translations for the selected language. The language itself may remain in the system but its customised content will be lost.

## Exporting Translations

You can download the translation data for any language as a JSON file.

1. Click the **Export** button (download icon) in the toolbar.
2. The **Export** dialog will open showing a list of available languages.
3. Click the name of the language you want to export. A preview of its translation data will appear on the right.
4. Click **Download** to save the file to your device.
