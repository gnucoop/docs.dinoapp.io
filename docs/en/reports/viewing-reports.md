## Viewing a Report

To view a report, click its row in the list or use the **View** action icon.

### 1. Selecting Metrics

If the report schema is linked to metrics, you will first see a metrics selection step.

1.  Choose values for the required metrics (e.g., Project, Location).
2.  Adjust the **Date Start** and **Date End** if needed.
3.  Click **Next** to generate and load the report.

### 2. Report Display

The report view shows the report title, date range, selected metrics, and the main report content, which is structured according to its schema.

!!! note "AI-generated content"
    If the report includes AI-generated text, you will see a progress indicator (e.g., "Generating report prompt 1 of 3") while the content is prepared. This happens automatically.

### 3. Exporting a Report

From the report view, you can export it in different formats.

*   **PDF**: Click the PDF button to download a PDF file.
*   **Excel (XLSX)**: Click the Excel button to download a spreadsheet.
*   **Word (DOCX)**: Click the Word button to download a Word document.

!!! warning "No exportable content"
    If you try to export to Excel and see a message that "No exportable widget was found," it means the report does not contain any table or chart data that can be put into a spreadsheet.
