# Edit Report

The Edit Report page allows you to modify an existing report. You can update its metrics, details, and other information after it has been created.

## Accessing the Edit Page

You can navigate to the Edit Report page in two ways:
*   From the main Reports list, click on a report's title or an edit action.
*   From within a report's detailed view, look for an **Edit** button or link.

## Editing Report Information

Once on the Edit Report page, you will see a form similar to the one used for creating a report. The form will be pre-filled with the report's current data.

### Steps to Edit a Report

1.  **Review the pre-filled data** in the form fields.
2.  **Make your changes** to any of the available fields, such as:
    *   **Primary Metrics:** Update the main numerical values for the report.
    *   **Secondary Metrics:** Edit additional data points if they are configured for your form schema.
    *   **Details:** Modify descriptive text, dates, or other supporting information.
3.  **Save your changes** by clicking the **Save** or **Update** button at the bottom of the form.

!!! tip "Optional Fields"
    Depending on your organization's configuration, some metric fields may be optional. These are often marked as such. You can leave optional fields blank if no data is available.

## Understanding the Form Schema

The structure and available fields on the Edit Report page are determined by the **form schema** set up by your administrator. This ensures data is collected consistently.

If you need to edit information that does not appear as a field, contact your administrator, as the form schema may need to be updated.

!!! warning "Data Integrity"
    Be cautious when editing historical report data, as changes can affect trend analysis and historical records. Ensure your updates are accurate.
