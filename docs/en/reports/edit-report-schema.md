# Edit Report Schema

The **Edit Report Schema** page allows you to create a new report schema or modify an existing one. A report schema defines the structure, layout, and data sources for a report in Dino.

## Configuring Report Data

The core of the report schema is defining which data from your form submissions will appear in the report. You can typically:

*   **Select Data Fields:** Choose specific fields from your connected form schemas to include as columns in the report.
*   **Set Display Names:** Customize the column header shown in the report for each selected field.
*   **Define Filters:** Set conditions to include only specific submissions that meet your criteria (e.g., submissions from a certain date range).

!!! warning "Data Source"
    A report schema must be connected to at least one form schema to have data to display. Ensure the relevant form exists before creating your report.

## Next Steps

After saving your report schema, you can:
*   [View the generated report](view-report.md) to see the data.
*   Return to this page to make further adjustments as needed.
