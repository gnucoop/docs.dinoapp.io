# Reports List

The Reports List page displays all submissions for a specific report schema. You can view, filter, search, and manage reports from this central location.

## Page Layout

When you navigate to a specific report type, you will see:

*   A list of reports (submissions) displayed in a table.
*   Column headers such as **Name**, **User**, **Area**, **Case**, **Location**, **Organization**, **Project**, **Status**, **Collected Since**, and **Collected Until**.
*   A **search and filter bar** at the top of the list.
*   A floating **Add** button (if you have permission to create new reports).

## Working with the Reports List

### 1. Viewing and Sorting Reports

The list displays reports based on the applied filters. By default, it shows the most recent reports.

*   Click on any column header that is sortable (like **Creation Date**) to sort the list in ascending or descending order.
*   Click on a row to select it. You can then perform actions on the selected report using the action buttons that appear.

### 2. Searching and Filtering

Use the search and filter bar above the list to find specific reports.

1.  Click in the **Search** field and type keywords to search across report data.
2.  Click the **filter icon** to open the filter panel.
3.  Select from available filters like **Project**, **Location**, **Area**, **Case**, **Organization**, or **Status**.
4.  Apply your filters to narrow down the list.

!!! tip "Saving Filters"
    You can save a frequently used combination of filters as a preset for quick access in the future using the preset manager in the filter panel.

### 3. Managing Reports

Actions you can perform on a report depend on your permissions.

*   **To view a report's details:** Click on the report's row in the list.
*   **To delete a report:** Select the report, then click the delete (trash can) icon. You will be asked to confirm this action.
*   **To favorite a report:** Select the report, then click the bookmark icon.

### 4. Creating a New Report

If you have the correct permissions, a floating **Add** button will be visible.

1.  Click the **Add** button.
2.  If the report schema uses AI features that require credits, a message will inform you of the credit cost.
    *   If you have sufficient credits, the new report form will open.
    *   If you do not have enough credits, a warning will appear, and you will need to add credits to your account before proceeding.

!!! warning "Credit Usage"
    Creating some reports may consume Dino-AI credits. Ensure you have sufficient credits in your account if you encounter a warning message.
