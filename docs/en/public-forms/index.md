# Public Forms

Public forms allow anyone with a link to submit data to Dino without needing to log in or have an account. This is commonly used for surveys, registrations, or feedback collection. If you have received a public link to a form, you can use this page to complete it.

## Accessing a Public Form

1.  Click the public form link you received (e.g., via email or a shared message).
2.  The form will open directly in your web browser. You do not need to sign in.
3.  Review the form title and any introductory text to confirm it's the correct form.

!!! tip
    Public form links are unique and often contain a long identifier (like `/f/abc123def`). If the page doesn't load, ensure the entire link was copied correctly.

## Completing and Submitting

1.  Fill in all the fields on the form. Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are **required**.
2.  If the form has multiple sections, use the navigation tabs or buttons at the top of the form to move between them.
3.  As you fill out fields, the form validates your input. Invalid entries are typically highlighted.
4.  Once all required fields are valid, the primary submit button (usually a circular button with a send icon) will become active.
5.  Click the submit button to send your data.

!!! warning
    The submit button will remain disabled (greyed out) if any required field is empty or contains invalid data. Scroll through the form to find and correct any highlighted issues.

## After Submission

Upon a successful submission, you will see a confirmation screen with a checkmark and the message: **"The form has been successfully submitted."**

A notification will also appear at the bottom of your screen. From this notification, you can:
*   **Fill out another one**: Click this to reload the page with a fresh, empty copy of the same form, allowing you to make another submission.
*   **Close**: Dismiss the notification.

## Troubleshooting

### The submit button is disabled.
This means the form is not yet valid. Check for:
*   **Empty required fields**: Ensure all fields marked with an asterisk (*) are filled.
*   **Invalid data**: Look for fields highlighted in red and correct the information (e.g., an invalid email format).

### "Unable to save form."
Your submission encountered a temporary error, often related to your internet connection.
1.  Click **"Try again"** in the notification at the bottom of the screen.
2.  If the error persists, check your internet connection and try refreshing the page.
3.  If it continues to fail, contact the person who sent you the form link.

### "Oops! We could not find this Form Schema."
The link you are using is incorrect or the form has been removed.
*   Verify you have the complete, correct URL.
*   Contact the person who shared the link with you for an updated one.

### The form does not load (blank page).
*   Refresh your browser page.
*   Ensure your internet connection is stable.
*   Confirm the link is complete and has not been truncated.
