# Forms

The Forms page is your central workspace for all structured data in Dino. Here, you can access every form schema, submit new data, review past submissions, and explore your data on a map or through conversational analysis.

When you open this page, you see a list of all available form schemas. Each item shows the form's name and icon.

## Navigating the Page

The main page lists all form schemas you have permission to use. You can interact with this list in several ways:

1.  **Open a Form Schema**: Click on any form in the list to go to its dedicated page, where you can see all its submissions.
2.  **Search**: Use the search bar at the top to find a specific form by name.
3.  **Filter and Sort**: Use the available controls to filter the list or sort it by different columns.

!!! tip "Starting Point"
    This list is your launchpad. Each form schema represents a different type of report, survey, or data collection task for your project.
