When you open the Data Collection area, you will see a list of all available form schemas. Each item in the list shows the form's name and icon.

## Navigating the Area

The main page shows all form schemas you have access to. You can interact with this list in several ways:

1.  **Open a Form**: Click on any form schema in the list to open its submissions list. This is where you can browse, add, or manage individual form entries.
2.  **Search and Filter**: Use the search bar at the top to quickly find a specific form by its name.
3.  **Sort**: Click on the column headers (like "Name") to sort the list.

!!! tip "Quick Access"
    The form list is your starting point for all data collection activities. Think of each form schema as a different type of report or survey you need to fill out.
