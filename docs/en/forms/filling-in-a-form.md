# Filling In a Form

This page explains how to fill in a new form submission. You can start a new submission by selecting a form from the list and clicking the **+** button.

## Selecting Metrics

!!! note "Optional Step"
    This step only appears if your form uses contextual metrics (like projects or locations). If you see the form fields directly, skip to the next section.

The first step is to select the context for your submission. This links your data to specific projects, locations, or other categories.

1.  Use the dropdown menus to choose a value for each required metric.
2.  Click **Go to form** or the forward arrow to proceed to the data entry fields.

You can return to this step at any time by clicking the back arrow at the top of the page.

!!! tip "Audio Input"
    If a microphone button is visible, you can record a spoken response. Dino will attempt to transcribe it and fill in the relevant fields automatically.

## Filling In the Form Fields

Enter your data into the fields on the page. Fields marked as required must be completed before you can save the final submission.

If the form is divided into multiple sections, you can switch between them using the tabs or navigation bar near the top of the form.

A status bar may show the current workflow stage of your submission.

## Saving Your Submission

Once you have entered your data, use the buttons in the bottom-right corner to save:

-   **Save form** (floppy disk icon): Saves the submission as final. This button is only active when all required fields are correctly filled.
-   **Save draft** (save-as icon): Saves your progress without completing all validation. Use this to finish your submission later.

!!! warning "Offline File Uploads"
    If your form includes file attachments and you are working offline, a warning will appear when you save. The submission data will be saved, but the attached files will queue for upload once you are back online.

A confirmation message will appear when your submission has been saved successfully.
