# Filling In a Form

This page explains how to fill in a new form submission or edit an existing one. You can start a new submission from a form's list view. To edit, open an existing submission from the list.

## Selecting Contextual Metrics

!!! note "Optional Step"
    This step only appears if your form schema uses contextual metrics, such as projects or locations. If you see the form fields directly, you can skip this section.

The first step is to select the context for your submission. This links your data to specific categories.

1.  Use the dropdown menus to choose a value for each required metric.
2.  Click **Go to form** or the forward arrow to proceed to the data entry fields.

You can return to this step at any time by clicking the back arrow at the top of the page.

## Filling In the Form Fields

Enter your data into the fields on the page. Fields marked as required must be completed before you can save a final submission.

If the form is divided into multiple sections, you can switch between them using the tabs or navigation near the top of the form.

A status bar may show the current workflow stage of your submission.

!!! tip "Audio Input"
    If a microphone button is visible next to a field, you can record a spoken response. Dino will attempt to transcribe it and fill in the field automatically.

## Saving Your Work

Once you have entered your data, use the buttons in the bottom-right corner to save:

-   **Save form** (floppy disk icon): Saves the submission as final. This button is only active when all required fields are correctly filled.
-   **Save draft** (save-as icon): Saves your progress without completing all validation. Use this to finish your submission later.

A confirmation message will appear when your submission has been saved successfully.

!!! warning "Offline File Uploads"
    If your form includes file attachments and you are working offline, a warning will appear when you save. The submission data will be saved, but the attached files will queue for upload once you are back online.

## Editing an Existing Submission

You can edit a submission you have already saved.

1.  Navigate to the list of submissions for a form.
2.  Click on the submission you wish to edit.
3.  The form will open with your previously entered data. Make your changes.
4.  Click **Save form** to update the submission.

!!! tip "Tracking Changes"
    When you edit and save a submission, Dino automatically records what was changed, who changed it, and when.
