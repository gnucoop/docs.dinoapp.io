# Edit a Form Submission

The Edit Form screen allows you to modify an existing form submission. You can update data, add new information, or save your changes as a draft to complete later.

When you open a form submission to edit, you see the same form interface used for data entry, but with all the previously saved data already filled in.

## How to Edit a Submission

1.  Navigate to the list of submissions for your form.
2.  Locate the specific submission you want to edit.
3.  Click the **Edit** button (usually represented by a pencil icon) for that submission. This opens the form in edit mode.

4.  Make your desired changes to any field in the form.
5.  Choose an action at the bottom of the form:
    *   **Save Draft**: Saves your current changes without submitting the form. You can return and edit it again later.
    *   **Submit**: Saves all changes and submits the updated form data.

!!! tip "Tracking Changes"
    Dino automatically logs the changes you make between the original submission and the edited version. This creates a history of who changed what and when.

## Available Features

While editing, you have access to the same features as when creating a new submission:

*   **Optional Metrics**: Some forms may have optional sections or questions that you can choose to fill out.
*   **File Upload**: Attach new files or replace existing ones if this feature is enabled for your form.
*   **Secondary Fields**: For certain data points, additional related fields may be displayed for more detailed entry.

!!! warning "Data Integrity"
    Be cautious when editing critical data. Other reports or analyses may depend on the original submitted values. Consider if creating a new, corrected submission might be more appropriate than editing an old one.
