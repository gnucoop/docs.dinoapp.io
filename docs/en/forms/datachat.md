When you open the Datachat page, you will see the DinoGPT interface and a terms of service agreement. You must read and accept the terms before you can start a chat session.

!!! warning "AI-Generated Information"
    DinoGPT generates answers based on the specific data in your form database. Its knowledge is limited to this data and may not be complete, accurate, or up-to-date. You are responsible for verifying any information provided. DinoGPT does not provide professional advice.

## Starting a Chat Session

To begin asking questions about your data:

1.  Read the **DinoGPT Terms of Use** displayed on the page.
2.  If you accept the terms, click the button or link to proceed. (The specific control will be visible in the interface).
3.  Once the terms are accepted, the main chat interface becomes active.
4.  Type your question about the form data into the input field and press Enter or click the send button.

The AI assistant will process your question and provide an answer based on the available submission data.

## During a Chat

    For better results, ask clear, specific questions about the data. For example, "What is the average age of respondents?" or "List all submissions from last week."
