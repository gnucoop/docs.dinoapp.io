# DinoGPT

DinoGPT is an AI assistant that lets you ask plain-language questions and receive answers drawn from a configured knowledge base. It is designed for direct conversation — you type a question and receive a response, along with references to the source documents the answer is based on.

!!! note "Optional feature"
    This feature requires a DINO-AI API key and may not be available in your installation. If you cannot see this option, contact your administrator.

## Accepting the Terms of Use

The first time you open DinoGPT, you will be shown a terms of use statement explaining how the assistant works, what it can and cannot do, and your responsibilities as a user. Read the terms and click **Accept** to continue.

Your acceptance is saved on your device, so you will not be asked again on future visits.

---

## Entering Your API Key

After accepting the terms, you will be asked to enter your **DINO-AI API key**.

1. Type your API key into the field.
2. Press **Enter** or click the **arrow button** to submit it.

The system will verify the key. If it is valid, a confirmation message will appear and the chat interface will load. Your key is saved on your device so you do not need to re-enter it next time.

!!! warning "Invalid API Key"
    If the key is rejected, check that you have entered it correctly. An error message will appear beneath the field if the key is not recognised.

!!! warning "Service unavailable"
    If the message *"DINO-AI is not responding at the moment"* appears, the service may be temporarily unavailable. Try again later.

## Asking Questions

Once the chat is ready, the assistant will greet you and a text input will appear at the bottom of the screen.

1. Select a **Namespace** from the dropdown to choose which knowledge base the assistant should draw from.
2. Click inside the text field and type your question.
3. Press **Enter** to send.
4. The assistant will process your question and display the answer in the chat history above.

You can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions. The assistant takes the full conversation history into account when generating each response.

## Understanding Responses

Each response from the assistant may include:

- **Answer text** — the assistant's response to your question.
- **Sources** — clickable chips showing the document or file the answer was drawn from, along with the page number if available. Click a source chip to read the relevant passage.
- **Suggested questions** — clickable chips with follow-up questions suggested by the assistant. Click one to send it directly.

## Providing Feedback

Responses include a **thumbs-up** and **thumbs-down** button. Use these to rate the quality of the answer. A confirmation message will appear when your feedback is sent.

## Troubleshooting

### Chat has reached its maximum length

!!! warning
    If the assistant replies that the chat has reached its maximum length, reload the page to start a new conversation.

### "Sorry, you don't have enough Credits!"

!!! warning
    Your account has run out of DINO-AI credits. A link may appear to purchase additional credits. If you need help, contact your administrator.
