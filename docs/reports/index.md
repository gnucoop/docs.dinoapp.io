# Reports

The Reports area gives you access to all report templates available to you. Each template defines a report structure that can be used to generate documents from your collected data.

## Browsing Report Templates

The Reports hub lists all available report templates, sorted alphabetically by label. Use the search bar at the top to filter templates by name.
