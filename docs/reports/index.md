# Reports

The Reports area gives you access to all report schemas available to you. Each schema defines a report structure that can be used to generate documents from your collected data.

## Browsing Report Schemas

The Reports hub lists all available report schemas, sorted alphabetically by label. Use the search bar at the top to filter schemas by name.

Click on a schema to open its list of generated reports.
