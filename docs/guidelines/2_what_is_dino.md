# What is DINO?

DINO is a web-based platform for data collection and reporting. Based on its predecessor DEWCO, DINO extends its functionality based on a more modern and functional technology.  
DINO is a software that users can easily learn; forms can be created using a graphical form builder or imported in XLSForm; forms can contain simple fields or complex objects like tables and dynamic fields from other forms; permissions can be granted on a per-form basis; several level of permissions can be created in order to manage complex data collection flows;  DINO also offers the possibility of working offline and synchronising when connection is available.   
Collecting data in a simple and effective way is the foundation of any activity in the field of sustainable development. Whether it is to improve understanding of phenomena or to measure the impact of one's actions, the ability to collect and manage data is at the heart of social work. Gnucoop has created a data collection software, DINO. The software, in its original version, was used to collect health data in UNHCR refugee camps. Today, the software has evolved and is used by different organizations in different contexts.  
DINO is the result of over 6 years of development, deployment and testing  in many diverse contexts of application. With its almost 400.000 lines of code, Dino is the application to collect and analyse data, measure project indicators, manage complex processes or monitor the organisation's Theory of Change.
