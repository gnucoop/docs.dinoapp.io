# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first screen you see after logging in. Depending on your installation, it appears in one of two modes.

---

## Menu Dashboard

In the default mode, the Dashboard displays a set of navigation cards — one for each area of the application you have access to:

- **Forms** — collect and manage data submissions.
- **Reports** — generate and view reports.
- **Metrics** — manage reference data such as projects, locations, and organisations. *(Hidden for guest-only users.)*
- **Users** — manage user accounts. *(Visible to administrators only.)*

Click a card to navigate to that area.

## Report Dashboard

In report mode, the Dashboard displays a report directly on the home screen — the report you have marked as a favourite.

If you have not yet added a report to your favourites, a message will appear:

> *Welcome to DINO! Please add a Report to your favorites to view it in the dashboard.*

To set a favourite report, open any report from the [Reports](../reports/index.md) area and use the **Add to favourites** row action.

## Guided Tour

The first time you open the Dashboard, a guided tour may start automatically to walk you through the main features of the application. The tour can be restarted at any time from the [User Area](../interface/index.md#user-area).
