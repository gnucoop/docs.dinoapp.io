# Metrics

Metrics are the reference data categories used across Dino to classify, organise, and filter your collected data. When filling in a form or generating a report, users select values from these categories — for example, choosing a project, a location, or an organisation.

The Metrics area is where administrators manage the lists of available values for each category.

## Metric Types

The hub displays the metric types that are active in your installation. Depending on your configuration, some or all of the following may be available:

| Metric type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Thematic Areas** | Areas of work or thematic groupings. |
| **Cases** | Individual cases, people, or beneficiaries tracked across submissions. |
| **Locations** | Geographic locations where data is collected. |
| **Projects** | Projects that submissions and reports are linked to. |
| **Organizations** | Organisations involved in or responsible for activities. |

Click on a metric type to open its management page.

## Managing Metric Values

Each metric type has its own management page where you can browse, create, edit, view, and delete entries. See [Managing Metrics](managing-metrics.md) for details.
